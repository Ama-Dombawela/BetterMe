                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This HTML and CSS code creates a splash screen that fades out to reveal the main content. The splash screen, using a `div` with `position: fixed`, covers the entire viewport and includes a looping video background styled with `object-fit: cover`. A semi-transparent overlay improves text readability. Flexbox centers the content, which includes a title, mission statement, and group details. The splash screen fades out after 3 seconds using `@keyframes fadeOut`, while the main content fades in after 6 seconds with `@keyframes fadeIn`. The design ensures a smooth, engaging transition, with `z-index: 9999` keeping the splash screen on top. This approach combines functionality and aesthetics for a polished user experience.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In the provided HTML file, accessibility is limited but includes some basic practices. The page uses generic tags like `div` and `p`, but lacks semantic elements such as `header` or `main`, which would improve structure for screen readers. The `video` element lacks captions or subtitles, making it less accessible for deaf or hard-of-hearing users. While the semi-transparent overlay ensures text readability, there are no ARIA roles or attributes to assist screen readers. To enhance accessibility, semantic tags should replace generic `div` elements, captions should be added to the video, and ARIA roles could be incorporated for better context. These improvements would make the page more inclusive.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML and CSS techniques in this page create a functional and visually appealing volunteer portal for "Better Me." Semantic HTML tags like `header`, `main`, and `footer` structure the content, while `section` organizes key areas like volunteer programs and feedback. CSS Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`) ensures responsive layouts for navigation, program cards, and the footer. Program cards are styled with `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `padding` for a modern look, while `hover` effects on buttons enhance interactivity. Key HTML tags like `div`, `img`, and `a` manage content and links, while CSS properties like `background-color`, `font-family`, and `animation` maintain a cohesive design and add subtle interactivity. This combination ensures a seamless, user-friendly experience.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in this page is addressed through semantic HTML tags like `header`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`, which improve screen reader navigation and SEO. The `img` tags include descriptive `alt` attributes for better image context, and the use of `label` with form elements like `select` and `textarea` ensures proper association for assistive technologies. ARIA roles and attributes, though not explicitly used here, could further enhance accessibility. The color contrast and font sizes are designed to be readable, and interactive elements like buttons and links are styled for clarity and ease of use. Overall, the page is structured and styled to be inclusive and user-friendly for all visitors.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML and CSS techniques used in these pages focus on creating a structured, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience. Semantic HTML tags like `header`, `section`, and `footer` organize content logically, improving accessibility and SEO. Headings (`h1` to `h3`) ensure proper hierarchy, while images include descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility. CSS Flexbox (`display: flex`) manages layouts, ensuring elements like navigation bars and content sections are aligned and spaced properly. Properties like `padding`, `margin`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` create clean, modern designs, while `color`, `font-family`, and `font-size` maintain a cohesive visual theme. Hover effects on buttons and links enhance interactivity, making the pages both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of the splash screen, volunteer, mental health, and physical health HTML files, several challenges were encountered and resolved, leading to valuable lessons learned. For the splash screen, synchronizing the fade-out and fade-in animations required precise timing with CSS `@keyframes` and testing across devices to ensure smooth transitions. In the volunteer page, accessibility was a challenge, which was addressed by using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and descriptive `alt` text for images, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing accessibility from the start. The mental health page faced performance issues due to multiple images, resolved by compressing files and implementing lazy loading, highlighting the need for media optimization. The physical health page had responsive design challenges, fixed with media queries and Flexbox, reinforcing the necessity of testing layouts on various screen sizes. Finally, maintaining consistent styling across pages was achieved by using a shared CSS file for common styles and separate files for page-specific styles, teaching the value of a modular CSS approach. These challenges underscored the importance of planning, testing, and optimizing for performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The pages created (splash screen, volunteer, mental health, and physical health) aim to comply with Janet regulations by adhering to web accessibility and usability standards. Semantic HTML tags like `header`, `main`, and `section` are used to structure content logically, improving accessibility for screen readers and search engines. Images include descriptive `alt` attributes, ensuring compliance with accessibility guidelines for visually impaired users. The pages are designed with responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox, ensuring they are usable across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, color contrast and font sizes are chosen to meet readability standards, and interactive elements like buttons and links are clearly labeled and functional. While efforts have been made to comply with Janet regulations, further testing with tools like WAVE or AXE could identify areas for improvement, such as adding ARIA roles or ensuring all form inputs have associated labels. Overall, the pages strive to meet accessibility and usability standards, but ongoing refinement may be needed for full compliance.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="feedback">Feedback page</h2><br>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The feedback form page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure both functionality and design appeal.Below are the techniques used;</p> 
                        <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
                        <p>The HTML structure uses semantic elements including , footer and fieldset which lead to an optimized layout design and better document readability. The form consists of input and  text entry fields as well as select menu elements and multiple types of buttons for form submission and reset functions. The page includes radio buttons with emoji ratings which enable users to share their experience through an exciting interface. The page integrates a file upload functionality also which lets users include images or PDF documents.</p>
                        <h4>CSS Structure</h4>
                        <p>Organizational alignment for the form comes through display: flex positioning which also enables application of a background image to enhance visual appeal. Programming CSS variables allows users to set standard color standards of --main-color: #046307; which simplifies maintenance operations. The page provides improved readability by using text contrasted between light and dark backgrounds and form fields implement border: 2px solid black; to enhance clarity. Interactive feedback is enabled by buttons that display box-shadow effects that give dimension alongside changing colors when users interact with them.</p>
                        <h4>JS Structure</h4>
                        <P>The user experience improves through JavaScript because the system checks forms correctly and shows how many characters remain in the comments field and provides a preview of what users will submit. Users receive a confirmation message through the system after they submit the form that their feedback information has been successfully processed</P>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p> Screen readers can be accessed through each input field because they contain associated label tag elements alongside placeholders that show users how to fill in the information. Active fields within the form become highlighted through :focus styles during keyboard navigation and users can move through the form using the Tab key. Users benefit from visual enhancement due to the implementation of black text with light backgrounds and green colors which create high contrast. All images in the user interface have alt attributes which help visually impaired people and the entire form adapts automatically to various screen sizes due to its responsive design.</p>

                <h2 id="team">Team page</h2><br>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
                        <p>The team page utilizes an ordered structure which displays members who implemented the website. At the beginning of the page a title section establishes teamwork importance through its central and bold text. The central section contains individual profiles which show member images together with their name and role and a record of their implemented pages.The containers keep all members in a consistent position for easy reading. The page implementation list has been structured for easy content perception. When users hover over the section dedicated to team member details they will view all details but the layout stays uncluttered</p> 
                        <h4>CSS Structure</h4>
                        <p>A full-page background image is applied, giving the page a professional and visually appealing look. To improve text readability, a dark overlay is used over the background, ensuring high contrast between the text and background elements. The team member profiles are arranged using a flexible grid layout, allowing them to be displayed responsively across different screen sizes.Each profile includes a hover effect, where the image slightly enlarges upon interaction, creating an interactive experience. When hovered over, a hidden details section smoothly slides up, revealing more information about the member. This transition effect is achieved using CSS animations and transformations, providing a smooth user experience. Responsive design techniques, such as media queries and flexible units, ensure that the page adapts well to different screen sizes, making it accessible and visually appealing across various devices.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The team page incorporates several accessibility features to ensure an inclusive experience for all users. High-contrast text colors are used to enhance readability, making sure content remains visible against the background. Keyboard navigation is fully supported, allowing users to move through the team member profiles without relying on a mouse. For visually impaired users, alternative text descriptions are added to all team member images, ensuring screen readers can convey the content effectively. The page follows a logical structure, with information arranged in a clear reading order, making it easy to understand. Additionally, the hover effects do not obstruct accessibility, as key information about each member remains visible without requiring interaction. The responsive design ensures that the page is user-friendly across various devices, making it accessible to a wider audience</p>

                        <p>The sitemap page visually represents the website structure using an interactive SVG-based layout with clickable nodes that link to different pages. A background video adds a dynamic effect, while the nodes and connecting lines clearly outline the site’s navigation. Each node changes color on hover, providing a smooth and interactive experience. The layout is responsive, adjusting node sizes and text for optimal viewing across all devices.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered, each providing an opportunity for growth and learning. One major obstacle was optimizing the design for responsiveness across various screen sizes. Initially, the layout didn't scale well on smaller devices, but after implementing flexible grids and media queries, the design became fully responsive. Another challenge involved meeting accessibility standards, which required careful attention to contrast, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation. By thoroughly testing the page with different assistive technologies, the team was able to resolve these issues and ensure a seamless experience for all users.Additionally, finding the right color combination was a significant hurdle. It was difficult to balance aesthetics with accessibility, as certain color combinations didn't offer enough contrast for readability. After several iterations, the team managed to find a blend that worked well for all users.Another obstacle was related to certain elements not working as expected, such as form inputs and hover effects. These elements didn’t function consistently across all browsers, which required additional troubleshooting and adjustments to ensure they performed seamlessly everywhere .Overcoming these challenges taught the importance of early planning, thorough testing, and continuous learning in web development, as well as the value of adaptability and persistence when faced with unexpected roadblocks</p>
